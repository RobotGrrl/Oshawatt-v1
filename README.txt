Oshawatt v1 

These are all the CAD files for the Oshawatt v1 robot. Included are the Autodesk Inventor 2013 files, as well as .eps files for all of the pieces. There are also 3d views of the major assemblies available online at http://robobrrd.com/oshawatt. The .eps files have the pieces in the proper dimensions, which can be seen when opening in Inkscape (or similar) and selecting the path to see the length. Be sure to read the other included .txt files for additional information.
